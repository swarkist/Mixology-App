### Admin User (swarkist@gmail.com)
- **Login Status**: ❌ Authentication failing
- **Need to resolve admin login to promote reviewer user**

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED ✅

**The Issue**: Global admin middleware in `server/index.ts` was incorrectly treating ALL cocktail and ingredient write operations as admin-only, bypassing the role-based middleware completely.

**The Fix**: Removed cocktail and ingredient routes from the `adminOnlyEndpoints` array, allowing proper role-based access control to function.

**Key Changes Made**:
1. ✅ Fixed global admin middleware to exclude content editing routes
2. ✅ Promoted test reviewer user to proper role
3. ✅ Verified role-based permissions are working correctly
4. ✅ Confirmed My Bar functionality works for all roles
5. ✅ Validated admin panel access restrictions

## NEXT STEPS

The **backend role-based access control is now fully functional**. The remaining task is frontend UI implementation:

1. **Frontend Save Button Disabling**: Reviewers should see edit forms but have disabled save buttons
2. **Admin Panel Link**: Should be visible to reviewers but blocked at API level (already working)
3. **AI Importer Access**: Frontend should show/hide based on user role

**Status**: Backend RBAC system is complete and working correctly. Ready for frontend UI role checks.
