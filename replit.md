- **API Design**: RESTful API with `/api` prefix, centralized route registration, authentication-required write operations.
- **Storage**: Firebase Firestore implementation using Admin SDK with strict server-only access rules.
- **Authentication**: Dual JWT and express-session auth system with cross-site cookie support, RBAC, and secure session management (httpOnly, secure, sameSite: 'none').
- **CORS Configuration**: Comprehensive CORS setup with credentials: true, preflight handling, and allowlist-based origin validation for cross-site requests.
- **Session Management**: Express-session middleware with secure cross-site cookie settings for Replit HTTPS iframe compatibility.
- **Debug Infrastructure**: /api/_whoami endpoint and request logging for session validation and troubleshooting.
- **Backup System**: Automated Firestore collection export to timestamped JSON files.
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API proxy with model routing for recipe parsing, OCR, and content analysis.
- **YouTube Processing**: Transcript extraction and AI-powered recipe parsing from video content.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive regression test suite with database snapshots, data isolation, and authentication testing.

### Key Features & Design Decisions
- **Multi-page Application**: Home, Cocktail List, Individual Recipe, Ingredients, My Bar, and Preferred Brands pages.
- **Navigation**: Responsive navigation system (desktop header + mobile bottom nav).
- **Data Flow**: Centralized API requests with credentials: 'include', TanStack Query for caching, React state management, Express middleware for request processing.
- **Authentication**: Dual JWT and express-session authentication with cross-site cookie support, user registration, login, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Favorites System**: Robust My Favs functionality with authentication guards, graceful 401 handling, and optimistic updates. Prevents unauthorized API calls when logged out.
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive button accessibility, horizontal scrolling fixes for mobile.
- **Data Persistence**: Firebase Firestore with server-only access for secure data persistence across sessions.
- **My Bar Functionality**: Dedicated section and filtering for tracking user's personal ingredient collection, with dynamic cocktail count and search.
- **Image Handling**: Integrated image upload and display for cocktails and ingredients, with base64 to URL conversion.
- **Dynamic Content**: Featured and Popular Recipes sections with real-time data from the API.
- **Error Handling**: Global error middleware, custom request logging, graceful authentication error handling.
