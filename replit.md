# Mixology Web Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for cocktail recipes and mixology. The application features a modern React frontend with shadcn/ui components, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM. The application now includes a complete navigation system with multiple pages: home page with cocktail browsing, dedicated cocktail list page, detailed recipe pages, and a comprehensive ingredients page with filtering and selection capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Documentation updates: Only update replit.md when running regression tests, not after individual fixes.
