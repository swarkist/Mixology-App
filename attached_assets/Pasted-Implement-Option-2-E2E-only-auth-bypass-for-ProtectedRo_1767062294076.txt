Implement Option 2: E2E-only auth bypass for ProtectedRoute to unblock form-based E2E tests.

Context:
- Playwright route interception cannot reliably mock /api/auth/me before TanStack Query runs on mount.
- This causes immediate redirect to /login for ProtectedRoute-wrapped pages, blocking Add/Edit form tests.
- We must keep test network isolation: no real login/test accounts, no third-party calls.

Requirements:
1) Add an E2E-only bypass in ProtectedRoute (or the auth gating layer it uses):
   - If import.meta.env.VITE_E2E === 'true':
       - Do NOT redirect to /login
       - Treat route as authenticated for gating purposes
       - Allow role override for admin routes using import.meta.env.VITE_E2E_ROLE (admin|reviewer|basic), default basic
   - When VITE_E2E is not true, behavior must be unchanged.

2) Ensure API authorization is NOT bypassed:
   - Protected backend endpoints must still require auth as before.
   - The bypass is only for client routing so we can access forms and assert UI.

3) Update Playwright fixtures so tests can set role per suite:
   - e2e/fixtures/base.ts or auth fixture:
     - Provide helper: setE2ERole('admin'|'reviewer'|'basic') by setting process.env.VITE_E2E_ROLE before launching context,
       or by using storageState/localStorage if needed.
   - Keep the global network tripwire in place.

4) Add/complete E2E tests for ProtectedRoute-wrapped Add/Edit pages that were blocked:
   - My Bar already covered; focus on Add Preferred Brand, Add/Edit pages, and any other ProtectedRoute forms.
   - Use mocked /api endpoints; do not depend on real DB state.

5) Update docs/pdos/spec-kit/web-test-backfill/tasks.md:
   - Mark the newly completed tasks with [x]
   - Add completion notes under each affected task
   - Do not change task IDs or order

6) Run Playwright after completing the phase:
   - All tests must pass before marking tasks complete.

Deliverables:
- Minimal code change in ProtectedRoute (E2E flag only)
- E2E tests for the previously blocked forms now passing
- Updated tasks.md checkboxes + notes
- Playwright suite passing
