### What the error means

Your page is calling the endpoint /api/auth/me, and the server is replying with 401 Unauthorized. That endpoint typically returns the currently authenticated user; a 401 here means the server didn’t receive valid credentials (session cookie or token), or the credentials it did receive are no longer valid.

---

### Common causes

- **Not logged in or session expired:** There’s no valid session yet, or it timed out.
- **Auth cookie not sent:**  
  - **Cross-origin request:** The API and frontend are on different origins, and the request didn’t include credentials.  
  - **Cookie flags:** Cookie’s SameSite, Domain, Path, or Secure flags prevent it from being included.
- **Invalid token header:** A missing, malformed, or expired Authorization: Bearer <token>.
- **CSRF protection:** The backend requires a CSRF token header/cookie that isn’t being sent.
- **Ephemeral dev host change:** Your dev URL changed (common in preview links), so cookies issued for the old host aren’t sent to the new one until you log in again.

### How to fix it

1. **Confirm you’re logged in successfully**
   - **Check login response:** In Network, find the login request and verify it returns 200 and sets a session cookie (Set-Cookie).  
   - **Re-login:** If the host changed or the cookie expired, sign in again.

2. **Ensure credentials are included in requests**
   - **Fetch (same origin):**
     ```ts
     await fetch('/api/auth/me', { credentials: 'same-origin' });
     ```
   - **Fetch (cross origin):**
     ```ts
     await fetch('https://api.example.com/auth/me', { credentials: 'include' });
     ```
   - **Axios:**
     ```ts
     axios.get('/api/auth/me', { withCredentials: true });
     ```

3. **Attach tokens when using header-based auth**
   ```ts
   await fetch('/api/auth/me', {
     headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` },
     credentials: 'same-origin',
   });
   ```

4. **Set correct cookie flags on the server**
   - **Same origin:** SameSite=Lax (default), Secure=true on HTTPS, HttpOnly=true, Path='/'.  
   - **Cross origin:** SameSite=None; Secure=true, Domain matches the target, Path='/'.
   - Example:
     ```ts
     res.cookie('session', token, {
       httpOnly: true,
       secure: true,
       sameSite: 'lax', // use 'none' if frontend and API are on different domains
       path: '/',
     });
     ```

5. **Handle CSRF if enabled**
   - Send the CSRF token header the backend expects (e.g., X-CSRF-Token) and ensure the CSRF cookie is present.

6. **Gracefully handle 401s on the client**
   - **Redirect to login** or trigger a **silent token refresh**. With React Query or Axios, add a response interceptor for 401 to centralize this logic.

### Quick diagnostics

- **Network tab:** Is a Cookie header present on the /api/auth/me request? What does the response body say?
- **Application tab → Cookies:** Does the session cookie exist for this host? Check Domain, Path, Expires, SameSite.
- **CORS check (if cross origin):** Server must send Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true and a specific Access-Control-Allow-Origin (not “*”).

Direct answer: The 401 means the server can’t identify an authenticated user for /api/auth/me. It’s usually caused by a missing/expired session or token, or cookies not being sent due to request settings or cookie flags. Log in again and ensure your request includes credentials (and token if used), and verify the server’s cookie/CORS configuration matches your deployment.
