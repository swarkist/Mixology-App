DIAGNOSE-ONLY (do not implement fixes yet)

Goal:
We suspect the Home page “Featured” and “Popular” cocktail lists are not loading after the E2E backfill.

Rules:
- DO NOT change production behavior.
- DO NOT commit any fix.
- You MAY add temporary logging or run commands locally, but revert any non-test code changes before finishing.
- Use concrete evidence: file paths, line numbers, request/response payloads, console logs, network traces.

Steps:
1) Reproduce
- Run the app and confirm the issue on the Home page.
- Capture: browser console errors + network requests related to Featured/Popular.

2) Identify the data flow
- Find the Home page component(s) responsible for Featured/Popular.
- Trace: UI -> query/fetch -> API route -> server handler -> datastore (or mock).
- List exact endpoints used (e.g. /api/cocktails/featured, /api/cocktails/popular, etc.) and where they are called.

3) Compare “before/after” suspects from the test backfill
- Check for any changes that could affect runtime data loading:
  - ProtectedRoute E2E bypass flags (should not impact Home)
  - Playwright route interception / tripwire (should not affect runtime)
  - Any shared client fetch wrappers / query keys / baseURL changes
  - Any changes to server/routes.ts or client query hooks

4) Root-cause hypothesis
- Provide 1–3 most likely root causes, each with supporting evidence.
- For each hypothesis, list the minimal fix that would resolve it (but DO NOT implement).

5) Test coverage check
- Search the existing Playwright suite: is there a test that would have caught “Featured/Popular not loading on Home”?
- If a test exists, specify:
  - test file + test name
  - why it didn’t fail (mocking? missing assertions? bypassed call?)
- If no test exists, propose the missing test case(s) and where they should live (e2e/core or e2e/visual).

Deliverables:
- Repro steps + evidence (console + network)
- Endpoint list + code trace (files/lines)
- Root-cause hypotheses (no fixes)
- Answer: “Do we already have a test that would catch this?” (Yes/No + why)
