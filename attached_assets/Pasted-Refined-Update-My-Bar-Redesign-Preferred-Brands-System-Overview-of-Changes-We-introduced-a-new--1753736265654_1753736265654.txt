Refined Update: My Bar Redesign & Preferred Brands System
Overview of Changes
We introduced a new entity called Preferred Brands and restructured how Ingredients, Preferred Brands, and the My Bar feature interact:
•	Preferred Brand and Proof fields are now part of the new Preferred Brands object, no longer under Ingredients.
•	Dedicated detail pages have been created for both Ingredients and Preferred Brands.
•	My Bar now tracks Preferred Brands instead of Ingredients.

Preferred Brands
Preferred Brands represent real-world branded products (e.g., Tanqueray Gin, Tito’s Vodka) and can be linked to multiple ingredients.
Fields
Basic Information:
•	Preferred Name (Text field) — Required
•	Proof (Numeric only) — Optional
(Replaces ABV and uses integers only)
Image Upload Section:
•	Single image upload with preview, remove/reset options
•	Functions like the image section in Add Cocktails/Ingredients
Ingredient Association Section:
•	Searchable field to associate this brand with one or more ingredients
•	Each association appears on its own line, similar to ingredients in cocktail recipes
Usage & Tags Section:
•	Uses the same pill-tag interface as Ingredients and Cocktails
•	Shares tag pool with Ingredient tags (no new tag category created)
Preferred Brand Detail Page
Each Preferred Brand has a standalone detail view showing:
•	Preferred Name
•	Proof
•	Image (or default FPO if none)
•	List of Associated Ingredients
•	Tags

Ingredient Detail Page
A new public-style detail view has been added for Ingredients.
Features:
•	Shows: Name, Category, Sub-Category, Description, and Tags
•	Displays associated Preferred Brands
•	Allows associating and removing Preferred Brands
•	Clicking a Preferred Brand opens its detail page

My Bar – Updated Behavior
Changes:
•	My Bar now stores Preferred Brands, not Ingredients
•	The toggle now appears on Preferred Brand cards
(default: "Not In My Bar" → toggled: "In My Bar")
•	Proof is shown on Preferred Brand cards (ABV is no longer used)
My Bar Page:
•	Accessible via top navigation link “My Bar”
•	Displays all Preferred Brands the user marked as “In My Bar”
•	Preferred Brands are grouped by their associated Ingredient
•	Each Preferred Brand card links to its detail view
•	Includes ability to unmark items from “In My Bar” directly from this view

Final Refinement: Cocktail Add/Edit Ingredient Search Behavior
When associating ingredients to a cocktail (during Add or Edit):
•	✅ The search field will match across:
o	Ingredient Name
o	Category
o	Sub-Category
o	Preferred Brand Name
Behavior for Preferred Brand Matches:
•	If the user selects a Preferred Brand from the search results:
o	The associated Ingredient will be automatically linked to the cocktail.
o	This allows users who recognize ingredients by brand name to still associate the correct ingredient.
o	The system resolves the brand-to-ingredient relationship internally — no extra step for the user.
•	No change in how Category or Sub-Category matching behaves.
