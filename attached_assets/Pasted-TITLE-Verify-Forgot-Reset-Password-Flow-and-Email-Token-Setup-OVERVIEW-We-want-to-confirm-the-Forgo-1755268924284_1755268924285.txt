TITLE
Verify Forgot/Reset Password Flow and Email Token Setup

OVERVIEW
We want to confirm the Forgot/Reset Password functionality is working in the Mixology app exactly as described in replit.md — with secure, neutral-message, token-based password reset. The agent should:
1. Review the backend and frontend code to confirm the flow exists and matches the documented behavior.
2. Verify that users can:
   - Submit their email via Forgot Password
   - Receive a short-lived, single-use reset token
   - Use the token to set a new password via Reset Password page
   - Get neutral responses to prevent account enumeration
3. Identify if SMTP/email sending is configured and what email-related token or credentials (e.g., SMTP API key, service account token) need to be added to Replit Secrets for the flow to work in production.
4. Run a quick local test of the flow against the running dev environment to ensure it works as implemented.

INSTRUCTIONS
- Search for `/api/auth/forgot` and `/api/auth/reset` routes in backend code.
- Confirm token creation, hashing, expiry, and single-use behavior match NIST/password security best practices.
- Locate the frontend ForgotPassword and ResetPassword pages, confirm they POST to the correct endpoints, handle neutral responses, and process reset tokens from query parameters.
- Confirm email sending logic: which library/service is used, what environment variables are required (e.g., SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, or API key for SendGrid/Mailgun).
- Report exactly which secret(s) need to be set in Replit Secrets for emails to send.
- If email sending is disabled in dev mode, identify where to enable it for production.

LOCAL TESTING STEPS
1. From the app's Forgot Password page, submit an existing user’s email and confirm the UI shows the neutral success message.
2. Check the email delivery method:
   - If SMTP is configured, retrieve the actual reset email from the configured inbox.
   - If SMTP is not configured, retrieve the reset link from console logs or dev output.
3. Visit the reset link in a browser or via cURL, set a new password, and confirm the password change works by logging in with the new password.
4. Attempt to re-use the reset token and confirm the neutral error is returned.
5. Verify that any existing sessions for that account are revoked upon reset.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Agent outputs confirmation that the Forgot/Reset Password flow exists and matches documentation.
- Lists the exact backend route handlers for forgot/reset and where token handling occurs.
- Lists the frontend pages/components involved.
- Confirms security controls (neutral message, token expiry, single-use).
- Identifies which email token/credentials to add to Replit Secrets so reset emails can send successfully.
- Provides the results of the local test, including the reset link source and the final login verification.
