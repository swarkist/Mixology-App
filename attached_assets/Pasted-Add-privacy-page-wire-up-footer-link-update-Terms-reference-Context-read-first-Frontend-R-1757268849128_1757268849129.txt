Add /privacy page + wire up footer link + update Terms reference

Context (read first):

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite, routing via Wouter (based on project docs).

Styling: Tailwind + shadcn/ui.

There is already a Footer with a “Privacy Policy” link that currently points to #.

Keep code idiomatic to the repo (imports, file structure, typography).

Accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and no console errors are required.

If file names/paths differ, confirm before coding.

🎯 Goals

Create a dedicated Privacy Policy page at /privacy.

Update the Footer’s “Privacy Policy” link to navigate to /privacy.

Ensure the Terms page text “See our Privacy Policy” links to /privacy.

🛠️ Tasks
1) Create PrivacyPolicy.tsx page

Location (adjust if your repo uses a different pattern):
client/src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.tsx

Use semantic HTML: <main>, <h1>, <section>, <h2>, <p>, lists.

Typography: same as Terms page (consistent spacing, readable line length).

If a document-title helper exists, set title: “Privacy Policy — Miximixology”.

Content (convert to JSX with proper tags):

# Miximixology Privacy Policy

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

At Miximixology, your privacy matters. This is a hobby site built for cocktail enthusiasts, and we keep things simple.

## 1. Information We Collect
When you use Miximixology, we may collect:
- Account Information: Your email, password (stored securely in hashed form), and role (basic, reviewer, admin).
- Preferences: Items saved in “My Bar” and “Preferred Brands.”
- Usage Data: Basic logs to ensure the site works properly (e.g., error logs, security checks).

We do not collect sensitive personal information beyond what is needed to provide the service.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
- To create and manage your account.
- To power site features like My Bar, Preferred Brands, and saved cocktail filters.
- To keep the site secure and prevent abuse.
- To contact you about account-related issues (e.g., password resets).

We do not sell, rent, or trade your information.

## 3. Third-Party Services
Miximixology relies on third-party providers to operate:
- Firebase (Firestore database) for storing recipes, ingredients, and account data.
- Replit hosting to serve the site and backend.
- SMTP email service (Zoho Mail) to send password reset emails.
- OpenRouter AI integrations for recipe imports and chatbot functionality.

Your data may pass through or be stored by these providers as part of normal operation. Their own terms and privacy policies also apply.

## 4. Data Security
- All passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.
- Role-based access control ensures only you can access your data.
- User data isolation fixes have been implemented to prevent cross-account access.
- Automated regression and security tests verify protections.

Still, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## 5. Data Retention & Deletion
- Your data remains in Miximixology until you delete your account.
- A self-delete feature is being added. Until then, you can request deletion by contacting us.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Miximixology is intended for hobby use by adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updates will be posted here, and continued use of the site means you accept the updated policy.

## 8. Contact
For questions or data requests, contact us at:
Email: support@miximixology.com

2) Register the /privacy route

In the central router (likely client/src/App.tsx or client/src/main.tsx), add:
/<Route ... path="/privacy" component={PrivacyPolicy} />/ or the project’s established Wouter pattern.

3) Wire up the Footer link

Find the Footer (e.g., client/src/components/Footer.tsx).

Replace the existing “Privacy Policy” link href="#" with a Wouter <Link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> (or the project’s link pattern).

Keep styling consistent (likely text-sm text-muted-foreground).

4) Update Terms page reference

Open client/src/pages/TermsPage.tsx (or wherever Terms lives).

Ensure the “See our Privacy Policy” text uses a <Link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>.

🧪 Verification Checklist (run & confirm)

Routing: /privacy loads with correct headings and sections; document title set if supported.

Footer: “Privacy Policy” link navigates to /privacy from multiple pages (Home, Cocktails, Ingredients, My Bar, Admin).

Terms Page: “Privacy Policy” link correctly routes to /privacy.

Accessibility:

One <h1> on the page; headings follow a logical order.

Link text is descriptive; focus ring visible on keyboard nav.

Contrast meets WCAG AA for small text in dark mode.

Mobile: No overflow; comfortable spacing & line height; footer not overlapping content.

Console: No new errors/warnings.

If anything differs from the expected file structure, stop and ask before coding. Summarize the discovered layout (router file, footer location, pages dir).

📁 Likely files to touch

client/src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.tsx (new)

client/src/App.tsx or client/src/main.tsx (route)

client/src/components/Footer.tsx (update link)

client/src/pages/TermsPage.tsx (ensure link)

✅ Deliverables

/privacy page implemented with the provided content.

Footer “Privacy Policy” link updated to route to /privacy.

Terms page cross-linking to /privacy.

Short test report confirming the checklist above, with screenshots of /privacy, a page showing the footer link, and the Terms reference.

Before coding: please confirm the router & footer file paths you found.
After coding: run the app and verify all links & pages work as described.
