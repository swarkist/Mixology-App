## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test ai-features.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Data Isolation

All AI feature tests use isolated test data with unique prefixes to prevent data contamination:
- Test cocktails: `ai_test_[timestamp]_CocktailName`
- Test ingredients: `ai_test_[timestamp]_IngredientName`
- Test brands: `AI_Test_Brand`

## Mocking External Services

AI service calls are designed to gracefully handle failures during testing:
- OpenRouter API calls may fail in test environment
- YouTube transcript extraction requires valid video IDs
- OCR processing requires valid image data
- Tests verify error handling rather than requiring actual AI responses
